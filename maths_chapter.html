            <h2>Important Topics for JEE Main</h2>
            <p>To qualify for JEE Main, you must make a proper strategy. The syllabus of this exam is vast, and it is challenging to complete it entirely. However, if you chalk out a proper strategy, you can easily qualify for this exam. You should emphasise on those topics which have more weightage in this exam. To do this, you can go through previous years’ papers and find out the weightage of each topic. In general, the following topics are the most important Maths topics for IIT JEE (Main).</p>
            <h3>1. Coordinate Geometry</h3>
            <p>Coordinate Geometry finds application in other fields of Maths like trigonometry, 3D Geometry, Calculus, Statistics, and so on. There are three categories in which this topic can be divided:</p>
            <l>
                <li><strong>2D Geometry:</strong> It has subdivisions like distance and sections formula, transformation of axis, area of triangle, and locus.</li>
                <li><strong>Straight Lines:</strong> In this section, you should study concepts related to straight lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Conic Section:</strong> This section demands a thorough understanding. It includes a circle, parabola, ellipse, hyperbola, and pair of straight lines.</li>
            </l>

            </div>
            <h3>3. 3D Geometry and Vectors</h3>
            <p>Before you start with this topic, make sure that you have a clear understanding of coordinate Geometry. This topic mainly covers sections related to: </p>
            <l>
                <li><strong>Distance between two points</strong>  </li>
                <li><strong>Direction cosines</strong> </li>
                <li><strong>Conic Section:</strong> </li>
                <li><strong>Section formula 
                </strong> </li>
                <li><strong>The angle between two intersecting lines </strong> </li>
                <li><strong>Equation and shortest distance of skew lines</strong> </li>
            </l>
            <h3>4. Algebra</h3>
            <p>It is one of the most important topics in Maths for IIT JEE. This topic, like most other topics of IIT JEE, demands clarity of concept. Under this topic, there are several sections which can be classified as follows:</p>
    
            <l>
                <li><strong>Quadratic Equations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Series and Progressions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Permutation and Combinations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Binomial Theorem</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Matrices and Determinants</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Complex Numbers</strong></li>
            </l>
            <h3>5. Trigonometry</h3>
            <p>This is a formula-based topic. Therefore, you must make it a point to revise the crucial formulae regularly. From this section, you can expect questions related to standard trigonometric identities, and solving these questions will demand significant grip on the formulae. 

                The topic mentioned above are of great significance if you want to qualify JEE Main. However, you should always go through the previous years’ papers to get a better understanding of the weightage of every topic.
                
                Although these are the important topics in Maths for IIT JEE, students should avoid skipping other topics.</p>

            <h2>Important Topics for JEE Advanced</h2>
            <p>The syllabus for JEE Main and JEE Advanced are almost similar except for a few topics. If you are already preparing for JEE Main, then it is easier for you to cover the syllabus of Advanced. However, while preparing for JEE Advanced, you should study every topic in detail. The questions of this exam are highly conceptual, and so while preparing you should focus more on quality rather than quantity. </p>
<p>
                The most important Maths topics for IIT JEE Advanced are quite similar to that of JEE Main. It includes:
            </p>
            <l>
                <li><strong>Conic Section</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Circle</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Calculus</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Vector and 3D Geometry</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Trigonometric Equations</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Complex Numbers</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Probability</strong></li>
            </l>
            <p>While deciding which are the important topics in Maths for JEE Advanced, you should go through previous years’ papers. When you are analysing these papers, you will get an idea of the weightage of each topic. The tables given below will help you in this process.</p>

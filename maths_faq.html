            <h2>Important Tips on JEE Main 2022 Mathematics Preparation</h2>
            <p>Now that we have understood what kind of questions can be expected in the JEE Main Maths section and what is the general difficulty level of JEE Main 2022 Session 1 examination, we can create a study strategy for the next year or even for the next JEE Main Session. Given below are some of the best tips from our JEE Main Maths experts.</p>
            <ol class="lop">
                <li>Focus more on Calculus and Algebra as many questions are asked from these two topics.</li>
                <li>Make sure to get your doubts solved as soon as possible if you are preparing for JEE Main 2022 Session 2 exam in July.</li>
                <li>Create a formula sheet for JEE Main 2022. Include all the important formulae for every topic you have studied. If you know any short-cut tricks, mention them on your formula sheet. Read this sheet at least once a day and revise all the formulae.</li>
                <li>Make your conceptual knowledge strong. Focus on understanding how to apply the concept rather than just learning how to use the formula. Once you know how to apply the concept, it will be much easier to solve the length of questions in the exam.</li>
                <li>Solve past year papers and sample papers every day. Practicing a variety of questions will help you prepare for all kinds of questions that can be asked in JEE Main. It will also make you familiar with the exam pattern of JEE Main.</li>
                <li>Keep revising the topics as it will make it easier to remember the concepts. Pay special attention to topics frequently asked in the examination.</li>
                <li>Get the right books and study materials that can help you solve questions and practice as much as possible. Recommended books include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>R.D. Sharma for Class XI & XII</li>
                        <li>Trigonometry by S.L. Loney</li>
                        <li>Coordinate Geometry by S.L. Loney</li>
                        <li>Higher Algebra by Hall Knight</li>
                        <li>Problems in Calculus of One Variable by L.A. Maron</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
